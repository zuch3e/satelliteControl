# Controlling a monitoring satellite
## Project for the Automated Systems Theory course
This project aims to build a compensator to control a monitoring satellite by applying many principles learned in the automated systems theory ( checking the initial stability of the system in question, building a specific compensator and making sure it respects the requirements of the model : specific phase margins, subsequent compensators and specific values for the sensibility function .... )
Coded using MATLAB.
